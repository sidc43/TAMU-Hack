## Inspiration
We think this is a real problem that students face and sometimes they might be hesitant to share it with a person, so we thought why not make a chatBot which could basically be a sort of an academic advisor
A semester of college costs $36,436 on average* 
When a single advising appointment could make or break your graduation dreams… 
Don’t take any chances

## What it does
Advisify is the AI powered virtual assistant you need. 
Advisify can analyze what classes you have taken and need to take in order to graduate.

## How we built it
We used html, css, javascript for front-end. And we used node.js for the back-end stuff. 

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into challenge when we had to show what classes student need to take in order to graduate from the .json file array and show it on the front-end. But eventually we managed to solve that by using fetch with get method.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Even though two of are teammates are freshman and all members are new in working with node.js and javascript, we think that we did fantastic job to get the first prototype out in these short span of 24 hours. 

## What we learned
We learned how to work with node.js, how to connect node.js with front-end. We enjoyed working together even after just meeting two of our teammates for the first time this hackathon. We learned how to use git to collaborate on a team project and how using it makes things work easily and fluently.

## What's next for Advisify.
We want to take Advisify to next level by integrating a fine-tuned AI model to it, which basically can get user-input and interact with user in humanly manner, because this time the time was limited we weren't able to integrate AI model yet but we do have a bright vision for Advisify.
We want Advisify to not only tell student what classes student needs to take for graduation but to advise in regards to their career, can tell student how they can improve their academic journey. We want Advisify to be one complete stop for student all academic advising stuff.
